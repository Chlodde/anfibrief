\fett{Starting times and locations}
Soon you'll notice: 9 o'clock means 09:15. At university lectures usually start c.t. (cum
tempore - lat., with time). If something starts \glqq sharp\grqq, it will be announced as s.t. (sine tempore - lat., without
time). In terms of times and locations you should take a look at alma before lectures start:\\
